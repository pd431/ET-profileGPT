While studying for my Computer Science with Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) bachelor, I took the opportunity of studying both IT and pedagogy to explore how the two can be used together, not in spite of each other. As part of that focus, I worked in partnership with academics to design, develop and showcase a fully integrated system to streamline student peer review in group work. I used knowledge I built up over my four years of study to guide my work, to very positive feedback from project stakeholders.

As a former student, and a current DLD within TEL, working both on the production and pilot versions of ELE, I've got a good level of familiarity with Moodle. Having experience (and access) to both sides of ELE really has helped me guide advice to academics to improve student experience while optimising workload for staff.

As part of my stage 2 module, Group Software, I lead my group's work towards building a web forum to discuss modules and other topics that integrated a clicker game functionality, making the most of open source technologies, and coding in our own features as required, where interactions with the forum were gamified to increase user retention, including over the long term. 
I also built a website as the school report and project demonstration for my first internship in a web development firm from scratch.

I have been putting my extensive multimedia experience in practice in supporting the Digital Maker Space, advising on purpose, and procedures for the video production equipment already present in the DMS, as well as advising new purchases to complement the limitations of the current kit. My personal projects include archiving DV family tapes, processing and digitising for film photography, editting down holywood films, optimising and re-encoding media for my personal media center server, repairing vintage lenses and cameras, and working as an event photographer. I also enjoy exploring older media, like vinyls, magnetic tapes, and microfilms.

I also have a good amount of experience in graphic design, digitalising or creating logos or cartoon characters from scratch. I have a keen eye for detail and consistency, and have regularly offer remastered logos to organisations or projects.  I am experienced in vector drawing and photo processing workflows, and familiar with video editting, both linear and non linear. I favour open source software and technologies when dealing with multimedia projects, but would adapt rather quickly to proprietary media editting suites like Adobe Creative Cloud. I'm also very interested in media storage, file formats, optimisations, resolutions and codecs, and their impact on storage, delivery and playback.

I also have a keen interest in copyright matters, what the legislation demands, and how implementations might differ from legal requirements. I fostered the interest in copyright and other rules through experiences like being member, and then president of my high school's debaiting society, I helped organise, assemble and participate in  and coach teams to high national rankings.

As a volunteer translator and support advisor for a chat based game with more than 1.5 million players at the time, I moved up to head for a both the translation team (covering more than 20 languages, with multiple variants each), and the support team (sometimes handling high hundreds of messages a day), all the while helping with server management, post mortems and being public relations officer. Working for a year and a half as part of dedicated voluteer teams taught me to appreciate people's time and value, but also the efficacy of engaging (either receiving or providing) in meaningful feedback with teammates, no matter the seniority or hierarchy. My timetable flexibility and eagerness to learn during this period also helped shape my approach to challenges. I improved existing skills by offering them up as solutions, and discovered new ones by looking for answers to challenges.

Juggling my final year and Captaincy for the archery club was an exceptionally forging challenge, especially in the context that we faced as a committee. One of our largest beginner intake, despite one of our lowest number of experienced members to coach novices and the loss of our main training hall following erroneous damage accusations. I had to paralellise and prioritise taks, like putting together reports and testimonies arguing against the accusations, arranging alternate venues, managing and running coaching, tensions within and outside the team, and more, all of it alongside my studies. I achived my (re-assessed) goal of passing on a functional club to a new committee after a year of managing incredibly varied and demanding workloads.

I like to think my enthusiasm helps me build positive relationships across the workplace and the wider university community. Engaging people with a smile and energy seems to help problem solve, faster, and more intelligently. I'm also always happy to work harder so me and others can work smarter later. I have found manual repetitive tasks to increase error rate as well as cost time, energy and enthusiasm, and am always keen to work towards reliable ways to automate redundancy out of existence.
