I am currently a DLD within TEL and have experience working on both the production and pilot versions of ELE. This has allowed me to guide academics on how to improve the student experience while also working on optimizing workload for staff. While studying for my Computer Science with TESOL bachelor's degree, I took the opportunity to explore how IT and pedagogy can be used together. I worked in partnership with academics to design, develop, and showcase a fully integrated system to streamline student peer review in group work. This project received positive feedback from stakeholders.

As part of my stage 2 module, Group Software, I led my group in building a web forum that integrated a clicker game functionality. We made use of open-source technologies and coded our own features as needed. We also gamified interactions with the forum to increase user retention over the long term. I also built a website from scratch as the school report and project demonstration for my first internship in a web development firm.

I have extensive experience in multimedia and have been putting it into practice by supporting the Digital Maker Space. I advise on the purpose and procedures for the video production equipment already present in the DMS and advise on new purchases to complement the limitations of the current kit. My personal projects include archiving DV family tapes, processing and digitizing for film photography, editing Hollywood films, optimizing and re-encoding media for my personal media centre server, repairing vintage lenses and cameras, and working as an event photographer. I also have experience in older media such as vinyls, magnetic tapes, and microfilms, and have a keen interest in media storage, file formats, optimizations, resolutions, and codecs and their impact on storage, delivery, and playback.

I am also experienced in graphic design and have a keen eye for detail and consistency. I have regularly offered remastered logos to organizations or projects. I am familiar with vector drawing and photo processing workflows and have experience in video editing, both linear and non-linear. I prefer open-source software and technologies when dealing with multimedia projects but can adapt quickly to proprietary media editing suites like Adobe Creative Cloud.

I have a keen interest in copyright matters and have fostered this interest through experiences such as being a member and president of my high school's debate society. I helped organize, assemble, and participate in teams that achieved high national rankings.

As a volunteer translator and support advisor for a chat-based game with more than 1.5 million players, I moved up to head both the translation team (covering more than 20 languages, with multiple variants each) and the support team (sometimes handling high hundreds of messages a day). I also helped with server management, post-mortems, and acted as a public relations officer. This experience taught me the importance of time management, effective communication, and teamwork. My timetable flexibility and eagerness to learn during this period also helped shape my approach to challenges. I improved existing skills by offering them as solutions and discovered new ones by looking for answers to challenges.

Juggling my final year of study with my internships and volunteer work has taught me valuable time-management and multitasking skills, and I have developed a strong work ethic as a result. I am eager to apply these skills in a professional setting and continue to learn and grow in my field.
